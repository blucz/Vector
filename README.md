Vector
======

Vector emulates a vector display, like those found in Asteroids and Tempest 
arcade games. It is implemented in OpenGL. (Open ES 2.0 on mobile).

It targets the iPad and OSX for now. For best results, use an iPad 4 or a
Retina MacBook. Vector runs poorly on the simulator and I haven't tested
anything slower than an iPad 4.

In its current state, it's a sample program that demoes the most basic of vector 
display functionality.

The files are organized as follows:

- *Vector/* implements a reusable and platform independent vector display.
- *ios/* make up the iOS demo app.
- *osx/* make up the Mac OSX demo app.

The font in the screenshots is the "simplex" font. More info on that: http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/hershey/
