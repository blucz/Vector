Vector
======

Vector emulates a vector display, like those found in Asteroids and Tempest 
arcade games. In its current state, it targets the iPad. For best results,
use a retina device. The vector effect is far more convincing with tiny 
pixels.

In its current state, it's a sample program that demoes the most basic of vector 
display functionality.

The following files:

    vector_display.c
    vector_display.h
    vector_display_platform.h
    vector_display_platform_ios.c

implement a reusable and platform independent vector display. The remaining 
files make up the iOS demo app.
